How about a kmeans clustering? (cell lines)
```{r}
wss.prism <- sapply(1:10, function(x) kmeans(breast_prism_imp, x)$tot.withinss)

plot(1:10, wss.prism, type = "b", xlab = "N of clusters", ylab = "Total within sum of square")
```

```{r}
wss.prism <- sapply(1:10, function(x) kmeans(t(breast_prism_imp), x)$tot.withinss)

plot(1:10, wss.prism, type = "b", xlab = "N of clusters", ylab = "Total within sum of square")

```
not very helpful...

```{r}
D = dist(t(breast_prism_imp))
library(cluster)

km = kmeans(x=t(breast_prism_imp), centers = 2, nstart = 10)
s = silhouette(km$cluster,D)
plot(s)
```
```{r}
library(cluster)

silhouette_results <- vector("list", length = 10)  # Create an empty list to store silhouette results

for (k in 1:6) {
  km <- kmeans(t(breast_prism_imp), centers = k, nstart = 10)
  silhouette_results[[k]] <- silhouette(km$cluster, D)
}

```
