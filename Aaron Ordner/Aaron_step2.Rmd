How about a kmeans clustering? (cell lines)
```{r}
wss.prism <- sapply(1:10, function(x) kmeans(breast_prism_imp, x)$tot.withinss)

plot(1:10, wss.prism, type = "b", xlab = "N of clusters", ylab = "Total within sum of square")
```

```{r}
wss.prism <- sapply(1:10, function(x) kmeans(t(breast_prism_imp), x)$tot.withinss)

plot(1:10, wss.prism, type = "b", xlab = "N of clusters", ylab = "Total within sum of square")

```
not very helpful...

```{r}

D <- dist(t(breast_prism_imp))
library(cluster)
sil <- vector()

for (k in 1:12) {
  km <- kmeans(x = t(breast_prism_imp), centers = k, iter.max = 10)
  s <- silhouette(km$cluster, D)
  sil <- c(sil, mean(s))
}
plot(1:12,sil)
```
The maximal QTR stage has been exceeded. This means we have to reduce the data.

```{r}
