  abstract = "Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have occasionally been
              found, but such discoveries have been serendipitous. We sought to
              create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory
              activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell
              lines. We used PRISM, a molecular barcoding method, to screen
              drugs against cell lines in pools. An unexpectedly large number
              of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer
              cell lines in a manner predictable from the cell lines' molecular
              features. Our findings include compounds that killed by inducing
              PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation; vanadium-containing compounds
              whose killing depended on the sulfate transporter SLC26A2; the
              alcohol dependence drug disulfiram, which killed cells with low
              expression of metallothioneins; and the anti-inflammatory drug
              tepoxalin, which killed via the multi-drug resistance protein
              ABCB1. The PRISM drug repurposing resource
              (https://depmap.org/repurposing) is a starting point to develop
              new oncology therapeutics, and more rarely, for potential direct
              clinical translation.",
