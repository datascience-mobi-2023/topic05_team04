# Introduction

# Materials and Methods

## Data 

### Prism Datasets  

**Prism:** effect of the treatment (columns) on cell growth of the cell lines (rows); includes drug, dosage and assay used

**Prism.treat:** for each treatment (rows) further information on the treatment and drug

**Prism.cl:** contains information about the different celllines    
*if we search after "breast" in the column lineage we get our 22 celllines*

### Cellline Datasets  

**Prism.exp:** contains levels of gene expression. Celllines (rows) and genes (columns)

**Prism.cnv:** contains copy number levels of genes. Normal is CN = 2. Gene names (rows) and celllines (columns)

**Prism.snv:** marks mutation in the different celllines als functional or nonfunctional to the cancer.

**Prism.achilles:** has information on how important a gene is for cell survival. Was generated using knockdown celllines. Gene names (rows) and celllines (colums)
   

## Data clean up/Filtering
Show distributions after cleanup
Abbildung für prism vorher nachher. Für andere maybe im Clean up

## imension reduction  
UMAP -> PCA wird rausgelassen; Plot den Luis gemacht hat. Ist nicht geclustert, aber man kann erkennen, dass die MOA sich in den gleichen areas aufhalten

## Clustering
kmeans -> Simon hat welche gemacht, aber die sehen kacke aus => Anna fragen

## Statistical test
Wilcoxson test
0.05 alpha
p adjust needed wegen sehr viele berechnungen und hoher fdr deswegen
Shapiro Wilk

## Lineare Regression
Prediction tool

# Results
First include positiv results; if space is left include negativ results: UMAP, K means clustering, promoting drugs

## Gene search engine
Goal: Arbeitsvereinfachung; Outcome: Overview over data

Maybe Website, ***Discussion***

Analysing the main datasets led to many individual data formats such as data frames, lists etc.; which contain relevant information gathered by our code. ***In general, one could get a possible important gene through literature analysis or comparing every meaningful value in our database manually, which is time-consuming and one could lose track.*** The aim of the function of the search engine was to quickly search for a gene of interest and display its attached values out of our main cell line datasets (prism.exp, prism.achilles, prism.cnv) for a more simple process of gene analysis. Based on this code, applications like looking for suitable treatments in prism.treat, loops which undergo printing every gene and their attached values in breast cancer celllines and the first approach for a relevant final data frame were realized.
The conclusive outcome of this engine development was a final modified search engine, in which one can type in the gene of interest and it prints every relevant value or information to get a decisive overview for drug repurposing applications.

## Gene analysis

### Correlation analysis
treatment response / gene expression; 
Goal: finding relevant genes; Outcome: giant data frame -> used for further work

copy number / gene expression
Goal: looking if hypothesis correct; Outcome: Histogram of correlations

The initial step in gene analysis was examining the correlation between different variables to determine if there were any connections between them. This approach aimed to identify genes that could potentially serve as indicators of a drug's effectiveness.
To begin, a correlation analysis between the gene expression data in prism.exp and the gene copy number data in prism.cnv was conducted. The method used was the Pearson correlation. Our hypothesis was that the copy number would correlate highly with gene expression, as higher copy numbers typically lead to increased transcription. Figure XX presents the histogram of the correlation calculations, which demonstrates that, for the majority of genes, a positive correlation indeed exists. The mean correlation was approximately 0.325, with a median of 0.345. Yet, the correlation is not as high as was expected.
In the subsequent step, we constructed a correlation matrix using Pearson correlation to examine the relationship between gene expression data from prism.exp and treatment response data from prism.treat. This correlation matrix allowed us to further refine our understanding of which genes were associated with specific treatments. The resulting matrix contains correlations between 18,805 genes and 1,395 treatments. The data was then used in the further gene analysis.


### Dataframe for targets involving genes
mean of data frames. Threshold for what genes are relevant. Used indings from correlation tests
Goal: finding interesting genes; Outcome: Data frame with many genes -> 48 genes data set with filtering after gene knockout score



### Statistical testing of important genes
Test wich of the found genes are for breast cancer of interest
Goal: find out which one are negativ, which ones are lower than other lineages; Outcome: 2 genes

## Linear regression
Perform drug by drug to avoid weird plot; For every drug one linear regression, R² Value and with those showing, that many of them are very good. Prediction model for concentration and drug name. Plot um das gnaze zu veranschaulichen;
Goal: Regression/Prediction model; Outcome: Regression/Prediction model

# Discussion
Search for papers mentioning certain genes found in the targets of the inhibitory drugs or
