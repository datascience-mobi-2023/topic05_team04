# Introduction

# Materials and Methods

## Data 

### Prism Datasets  

**Prism:** effect of the treatment (columns) on cell growth of the cell lines (rows); includes drug, dosage and assay used

**Prism.treat:** for each treatment (rows) further information on the treatment and drug

**Prism.cl:** contains information about the different celllines    
*if we search after "breast" in the column lineage we get our 22 celllines*

### Cellline Datasets  

**Prism.exp:** contains levels of gene expression. Celllines (rows) and genes (columns)

**Prism.cnv:** contains copy number levels of genes. Normal is CN = 2. Gene names (rows) and celllines (columns)

**Prism.snv:** marks mutation in the different celllines als functional or nonfunctional to the cancer.

**Prism.achilles:** has information on how important a gene is for cell survival. Was generated using knockdown celllines. Gene names (rows) and celllines (colums)

Analysing the main datasets led to many individual data formats such as data frames, lists etc.; which contain relevant information gathered by our code. ***In general, one could get a possible important gene through literature analysis or comparing every meaningful value in our database manually, which is time-consuming and one could lose track.*** The aim of the function of the search engine was to quickly search for a gene of interest and display its attached values out of our main cell line datasets (prism.exp, prism.achilles, prism.cnv) for a more simple process of gene analysis. Based on this code, applications like looking for suitable treatments in prism.treat, loops which undergo printing every gene and their attached values in breast cancer celllines and the first approach for a relevant final data frame were realized.
The conclusive outcome of this engine development was a final modified search engine, in which one can type in the gene of interest and it prints every relevant value or information to get a decisive overview for drug repurposing applications.

## Gene analysis

### Correlation analysis
treatment response / gene expression; 
Goal: finding relevant genes; Outcome: giant data frame -> used for further work

copy number / gene expression
Goal: looking if hypothesis correct; Outcome: Histogram of correlations

The initial step in gene analysis was examining the correlation between different variables to determine if there were any connections between them. This approach aimed to identify genes that could potentially serve as indicators of a drug's effectiveness.
To begin, a correlation analysis between the gene expression data in prism.exp and the gene copy number data in prism.cnv was conducted. The method used was the Pearson correlation. Our hypothesis was that the copy number would correlate highly with gene expression, as higher copy numbers typically lead to increased transcription. Figure XX presents the histogram of the correlation calculations, which demonstrates that, for the majority of genes, a positive correlation indeed exists. The mean correlation was approximately 0.325, with a median of 0.345. Yet, the correlation is not as high as was expected.
In the subsequent step, we constructed a correlation matrix using Pearson correlation to examine the relationship between gene expression data from prism.exp and treatment response data from prism.treat. This correlation matrix allowed us to further refine our understanding of which genes were associated with specific treatments. The resulting matrix contains correlations between 18,805 genes and 1,395 treatments. The data was then used in the further gene analysis.


### Statistical testing of important genes
Test wich of the found genes are for breast cancer of interest
Goal: find out which one are negativ, which ones are lower than other lineages; Outcome: 2 genes

A threshold of absolute correlation greater than 0.75 was applied to select genes for subsequent analysis. This threshold was selected as it is the mean of the highest absolute correlation for each treatment. The filtering resulted in selection of 3925 genes out of the total 18119 genes in the prism.achilles dataset. These genes were then sorted based on their prism.achilles scores being lower than 0 and then a one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test with significance level 0.05 was performed to assess if their mean scores were significantly lower than those of other lineages. As previous Shapiro-Wilk-Test showed the data is not normally distributed and therefore a non-parametric test was needed. The p-values were adjusted using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. One gene showed a significant difference, SDHC with a p-value of 0.025.


### Dataframe for targets involving genes
mean of data frames. Threshold for what genes are relevant. Used indings from correlation tests
Goal: finding interesting genes; Outcome: Data frame with many genes -> 48 genes data set with filtering after gene knockout score

Moreover, the 3925 preselected genes were compiled into a data frame for further research. Genes with a mean achilles score below -1 for breast cell lines were included in the final data frame. 108 preselected genes fulfilled this criterion. This data frame includes information such as the frequency of high absolute correlation with a treatment, mean prism.exp score, mean prism.achilles score and the p-value from the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Furthermore, it provides additional details on gene mutations in breast cancer cell lines, treatments targeting the gene, and its association with any cancer hallmarks. This data frame concludes our gene analysis as it combines our gene selection process with general information we gather about the genes along the way. Two genes showed a high frequency amongst treatments, mTOR and AURKA. These genes were associated with more than 20 treatments during the analysis.

## Linear regression
Perform drug by drug to avoid weird plot; For every drug one linear regression, R² Value and with those showing, that many of them are very good. Prediction model for concentration and drug name. Plot um das gnaze zu veranschaulichen;
Goal: Regression/Prediction model; Outcome: Regression/Prediction model
